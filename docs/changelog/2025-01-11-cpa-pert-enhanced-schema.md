4. **Robust Submission Management**: Complete workflow from draft to CPA submission
5. **Data Integrity**: Checksums and audit trails for compliance
6. **Daily Time Logs**: Accurate hour tracking with eligibility flags

### Breaking Changes
- None - Changes are backward compatible with enhanced features

### Migration Required
- Existing experiences need date migration (can use same date for start/end initially)
- Run database setup script to create new tables and indexes

## Testing Instructions

1. Run database setup to create new tables:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

2. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   npm test backend/tests/unit/services/cpaPertServiceEnhanced.test.js
   ```

3. Test new endpoints via API:
   - Create report with date ranges
   - Add experience with start/end dates
   - Add experience breakdown
   - Track daily time
   - Record progress milestone
   - Submit to CPA
