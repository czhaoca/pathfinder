## Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@example.com
SMTP_PASS=password
EMAIL_FROM="Pathfinder <noreply@example.com>"

# Export Configuration
EXPORT_PATH=/var/exports
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

# Scheduler Configuration

```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations in order
npm run db:migrate
```

### Start Services
```bash
# Start deletion scheduler
npm run scheduler:start

# Or include in main app startup
```

### Verify Installation
1. Check deletion queue table exists
2. Verify email service connectivity
3. Test export directory permissions
4. Confirm scheduler running
5. Validate admin roles configured

## Performance Considerations
