## Technical Architecture

### System Components

1. **Database Layer**
   - Oracle Autonomous Database with user-prefixed schemas
   - Partitioned tables for analytics data
   - OCI Object Storage for cold/archive data

2. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication with 15-minute tokens
   - OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, LinkedIn)
   - Multi-layer DDoS protection
   - Feature flag controlled access

3. **Analytics Pipeline**
   - Real-time event ingestion
   - Batch aggregation processing
   - Tiered storage (hot/cold/archive)
   - Cross-tier query capabilities

4. **Admin Interface**
   - Unified management panel
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Feature flag controls
   - User management tools

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| DDoS attacks during registration | Multi-layer protection, quick disable feature flag |
| Storage costs for analytics | Tiered storage with OCI, data compression |
| OAuth provider outages | Fallback to password authentication |
| Performance degradation | Caching, query optimization, progressive loading |
| Security breaches | Encryption, audit logging, access controls |

## Notes for Developers

1. All database changes are pre-deployment (no migrations needed initially)
2. Use existing HIPAA-level security patterns from the platform
3. Leverage Redis for caching and rate limiting
4. Follow the established multi-user architecture patterns
5. Ensure all features are feature-flag controlled for gradual rollout

## Assumptions Used

As requested, these issues were created with the following assumptions:

1. **Invitation tokens**: 7-day expiration with user-set passwords (more secure)
2. **Essential fields**: email, name, password; Extended fields based on feature needs
3. **SSO linking**: Manual linking with password confirmation for security
4. **Analytics retention**: 90 days hot, 1 year cold, then archive (cost-effective)
5. **Feature flags**: System + user group level (good balance of flexibility)

These assumptions balance security, user experience, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining the platform's HIPAA-level security standards.
