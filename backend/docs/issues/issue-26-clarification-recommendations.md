# Issue #26: LinkedIn Recommendations Import - Clarification

## Status: Not Implemented (Future Enhancement)

### Rationale

The LinkedIn recommendations import feature mentioned in the acceptance criteria has been intentionally deferred for the following reasons:

1. **LinkedIn API Limitations**: The current LinkedIn API v2 has restricted access to recommendations data. Accessing recommendations requires additional API permissions that are typically only granted to LinkedIn partner applications.

2. **Privacy Considerations**: Recommendations involve third-party content (written by others about the user) which raises additional privacy and consent considerations.

3. **MVP Focus**: The core functionality of profile import (work experience, education, skills, certifications) provides immediate value without recommendations.

### Current Implementation

The following profile data IS imported:
- ✅ Work experience history
- ✅ Education background  
- ✅ Skills and endorsements
- ✅ Professional summary
- ✅ Certifications
- ✅ Profile photo
- ✅ Industry and location

### Future Enhancement

When implementing recommendations import in a future iteration:

1. **API Requirements**:
   - Apply for LinkedIn partner status
   - Request `r_recommendations` scope access
   - Implement recommendation-specific endpoints

2. **Data Model**:
   ```javascript
   recommendations: [{
     id: String,
     recommenderName: String,
     recommenderTitle: String,
     recommendationText: String,
     relationship: String,
     createdAt: Date
   }]
   ```

3. **UI Considerations**:
   - Display recommendations in profile view
   - Allow selective import of recommendations
   - Privacy controls for recommendation visibility

### Recommendation

Accept the current implementation as meeting MVP requirements. Create a separate issue for recommendations import as a future enhancement once LinkedIn partner access is obtained.
